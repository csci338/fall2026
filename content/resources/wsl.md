The **Windows Subsystem for Linux** (WSL) lets Windows users run a GNU/Linux environment -- including most command-line tools, utilities, and applications -- directly on Windows, unmodified, without the overhead of a traditional virtual machine or dualboot setup.

## Basic Installation Workflow
1. From powershell, install wsl:<br> `wsl --install`
    * This should install WSL and the default Ubuntu distribution of Linux.
    * It should prompt you to create a username and a password. **Write your username and password down** so you don't forget it.
2. Verify that a Linux distribution has been installed by typing:<br> `wsl --list --verbose`
3. Now you can run bash commands!
4. To shutdown your wsl instance, just type:<br>`wsl --shutdown`
