> ## Learning Goals
> The goals with this lab are as follows:
> 
> 1. Getting more familiar with git
> 2. Practicing adding and committing
> 3. Practicing with the linux command line

## 1. Git Basics

On GitHub: 
1. Navigate to your fork of the `class-exercises-fall2026` repository. Sync your fork to incorporate new changes into the main branch by clicking the "sync fork" button (below the green "Code" button).

On your laptop: 
1. Navigate to your version of `class-exercises-fall2026`, located inside of your `csci338` folder.
1. Check which branch you're on using the `git branch` command.
1. Check if you have any uncommitted changes using the `git status` command. 
    * If you have lingering changes, stage and commit them. 
1. Checkout the main branch: `git checkout main`
1. Pull the latest changes from your remote main branch into your local main branch: `git pull origin main`
1. If you did it correctly, you should notice that you should now have a `lab03` directory inside of your `class-exercises-fall2026` folder.
1. Create a new branch (while on the main branch) to do our work for lab 3: `git checkout -b lab03-b`
    * Note that branches are created from the branch you're currently on (in this case `main`). Therefore, it's important to pay attention to which branch you're on before making new branches.
    * Typically, you always branch from `main`. 

Use the `lab03/answers.md` markdown file to answer questions as you're
going through the lab.

**Note:** Whenever the lab says "What do you see?" that usually means to copy the command and the output to your `answers.md` file. You should do this in Markdown's preformatted mode which is simply 3 backticks before and after the block. 

### Getting Help

Git has fairly good documentation that's easily available (and often
faster than using Chat GPT). Read through
[this](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Getting-Help) to
see how to access it.

### Create a New Git Repository
Create a new repository for code exercises directly inside of your `csci338` directory. To do this, create a directory called `lab03-exercises` using the `mkdir` command.

```
mkdir lab03-exercises
```

{:.info}
> **Important**: Make sure you **DO NOT** create the `lab03-exercises` repo inside of your `class-exercises-fall2026` repo (remember: no nested repos). Instead, `lab03-exercises` should be in a *sibling*  directory. So, your directory structure should look something like this:
>
```
> csci338
> ├── class-exercises-fall2026
> ├── lab03-exercises
> ├── merge-activity
> └── rebase-activity
```

Verify that you've created your new `lab03-exercises` directory directly inside of `csci338` before proceeding. Then, change your working directory to `csci338/lab03-exercises`. Within `lab03-exercises`, create a new markdown file called `README.md`. Add a header to the top.

Great! First let's try to commit this.

```
git add README.md
```

Oh no! Something went wrong. What error do you see?

The problem is we haven't created a repository yet. Before we fix
this, let's take a look at what we have in the directory using the
`ls` command, along with the flags to show all hidden files. If you
don't remember the flag to look for hidden files, take a look at the command line cheatsheet on the course website.

You should see a single file, the `README.md` file you made. Now let's
initialize the our new git repository.

```
git init
```

Git will initialize a repository for you. Now let's list the contents of the directory again (including hidden files). Do you see anything new? Is it a directory or a file? How can you tell? List the contents of the new directory. 

> 1.1. What do you see? Copy the output to your `answers.md` file.
{:.blockquote-no-margin}

This is Git's internal implementation. You generally won't have to look in here, but whenever you're working in a Git repository, this special directory
will exist.

### Our First Commit!

Git is _stateful_ and _modal_, which means that it sometimes behaves
differently depending on what state or mode it's in. It's a good idea
to get in the habit of checking Git's state prior to making any
changes. Let's do that now with the `status` subcommand.

```bash
git status
```

> 1.2. What do you see? Copy the output to your `answers.md` file.
{:.blockquote-no-margin}

When you issue the `git status command`, you're usually looking for 2 things:
1. The `branch` you're on (in this case, `main`) and 
2. a list of untracked files (in this case, just `README.md`).

Let's add `README.md` to Git's staging area using the `add`
subcommand.

```bash
git add README.md
```

Hmmmm, there was no output from that command. What to do? Is there a
way you can check the state of git to confirm that your file was added
(hint: see above)?

Note that `README.md` is under the `Changes to be committed` header
now. That means this file will be included on our next commit. Let's
do that now.

```bash
git commit -m "add README.md to the repository"
```

What do you see? After you commit this, let's check the state of the repository. 

> 1.3. What do you see? Copy the output to your `answers.md` file.
{:.blockquote-no-margin}

Now that our repository has history, let's explore that history. To do
that, we use the `log` subcommand.

```bash
git log
```
> 1.4. What do you see? Copy the output to your `answers.md` file.
{:.blockquote-no-margin}

The [`log` subcommand](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-log) has a lot of great
features that we'll want to use going forward, but for now let's just
bask in the glory of the fact we've created a brand new git repository
and made our first commit to it!

Now let's modify our file.  Open `README.md` and add the following description of the first problem we are going to solve, and then save
the file.

> ### Add to README.md
> #### Find All Duplicates
> Write a function (in python) or method (in Java) that accepts a list of integers and returns a list of only those integers that appear more than once. 


Now that we have a change, let's check Git's state. What's different
about this message than when we first added the `README.md` file?

You can see what has changed between the previous commit and now with
the `diff` subcommand.

```
git diff
```
> 1.5. What do you see? Copy the output to your `answers.md` file.
{:.blockquote-no-margin}

Let's add this change to Git's staging area and commit it with a commit message "add first problem".

### Reflection and Review

We've learned 6 git subcommands now. In your `answers.md` file,
describe each of them in your own words.

### Practice

{:.info}
> **Programming Readiness: Practice (R2, R3, and R5)**
> This is formative practice, not Verification, so it cannot earn a Satisfactory readiness mark. Complete it without GenAI to get an accurate picture of what you can do before the next paper attempt.

**DO NOT USE CHAT GPT FOR THIS SECTION**

You may use Google, but you may not cut and paste any code.

Let's write some code. Create a new directory called `java` and let's
answer that first coding question in a file called `FindDuplicates.java`. In it, create a static method called `findDuplicatesNestedLoops` that takes a list of integers as an argument and returns a list of integers that have duplicates. Use a "nested loop" strategy to implement your method. Then, in your `main` function, invoke your `findDuplicatesNestedLoops` method with a few examples to confirm it's working correctly. Here's a sample stub of `FindDuplicates.java`:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.List;

public class FindDuplicates {

    public static List<Integer> findDuplicatesNestedLoops(List<Integer> l) {
        // replace "return null" with your code:


        return null;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // some test strings:
        List<Integer> sample1 = new ArrayList<Integer>(Arrays.asList(3, 7, 5, 6, 7, 4, 8, 5, 7, 66));
        List<Integer> sample2 = new ArrayList<Integer>(Arrays.asList(3, 5, 6, 4, 4, 5, 66, 6, 7, 6));
        List<Integer> sample3 = new ArrayList<Integer>(Arrays.asList(3, 0, 5, 1, 0));
        List<Integer> sample4 = new ArrayList<Integer>(Arrays.asList(3));
        System.out.println("Sample 1: " + findDuplicatesNestedLoops(sample1));
        System.out.println("Sample 2: " + findDuplicatesNestedLoops(sample2));
        System.out.println("Sample 3: " + findDuplicatesNestedLoops(sample3));
        System.out.println("Sample 4: " + findDuplicatesNestedLoops(sample4));
    }

}
```

You can compile and run your code using:

```
javac FindDuplicates.java
java FindDuplicates
```

Before committing, add and run checks for an empty list, a one-element list, no duplicates, one duplicate, multiple duplicates, and negative values. For each check, compare the actual and expected lists and print `PASS` or `FAIL`. Use any failure to revise your method, then record one correction in `answers.md`.

Once you have that working, let's add it and commit it to the
repository.

## Github

Github is not Git. Github is essentially a code management platform
that creates an ecosystem of software-related tools around Git. In this section, we'll push our repository to Github.

### Create a New Repository

On Github, click the "New" button that's next to your list of
repos. Let's call it `lab03-exercises` (same as our local repo name, though you could name it something different). Please make it **public**. Leave all of the GitHub options unchecked (i.e. Add README, Add .gitignore, Choose license).

Once you click the green "Create repository" button, you'll see some
instructions. We're going to follow the ones labeled "push an existing
repository from the command line."

> ### Important: Use the ssh protocol
You'll note that when you make a new repository, there are two ways to interact with GitHub: HTTPS and SSH. Please make sure that the **SSH** button is selected (not HTTPS) and that your origin looks something like this: `git@github.com:your-git-handle/your-repo.git`

Note that the second command is redundant since we already call our
default branch `main`. But let's go ahead and do it anyway.

Once you push, reload the Github page in your browser, and you should
see your readme file in all its glory!

### Git is Distributed

What we've done is we've created a _copy_ of our repository on
Github's servers. In Git, a copy of the repo living somewhere else is
called a `remote`. Note that this doesn't mean that Github is the
"source of truth" for our code, it just means that Github is a
copy. By convention, we can think of the Github version of our code as
the source of truth, and the clones that live everywhere else as
secondary, but we don't have to.

We can even create other remotes, other than "origin" if we want. The
`remote` subcommand will list all of our remotes (using the `-v` flag
will show us 'verbose' details).

```
git remote -v
```

Once we make a _local_ change to our repository, we have to _push_ the
changes to our remote to see them reflected.

### More Practice

**DO NOT USE CHAT GPT FOR THIS SECTION**

You may use Google, but you may not cut and paste any code.

Let's add a directory called `python` and repeat this exercise in
Python. Generally, Python doesn't use CamelCase for filenames, so name
your file `find_duplicates.py`. In it, you will implement a function called `find_duplicates_nested_loop`. Here's a basic python skeleton program you
can run.

```py
def find_duplicates_nested_loop(l: list) -> list:
    # Replace "return None" with your code
    return None

# In Python, if __name__ == "__main__" is a conditional check that determines whether 
# a Python file is being run as the main program or imported as a module into another 
# script.
if __name__ == "__main__":
    sample1 = [3, 7, 5, 6, 7, 4, 8, 5, 7, 66]
    sample2 = [3, 5, 6, 4, 4, 5, 66, 6, 7, 6]
    sample3 = [3, 0, 5, 1, 0]
    sample4 = [3]
    
    print("Sample 1:", find_duplicates_nested_loop(sample1))
    print("Sample 2:", find_duplicates_nested_loop(sample2))
    print("Sample 3:", find_duplicates_nested_loop(sample3))
    print("Sample 4:", find_duplicates_nested_loop(sample4))
```

You can run it like this:

```
python3 find_duplicates.py
```

Go ahead and modify the `find_duplicates_nested_loop` function so it works as we
described. Once you have it working, add it and commit it to the
repository. Take a look at your Git history. What do you see? Take a
look at your repo on Github and click on the "commits" link. Do you
see the commit you just made?

Let's take a look at the state of our local repository first. What do
you see? Do you see any messages that suggest that there's a
difference between your local repository and the remote repository?

Now let's push these changes to our remote.

```
git push origin main
```

Some notes:
* If you reload your Github repository and you should now see your latest commit on GitHub.
* Similarly, if you type `git status` on the command line again, you can see that your current and remote branches are the same.

## Branching

So far we've been committing directly to the `main` branch and pushing that branch to the remote. This is fine for personal projects, or experimental codebases. It's not fine for production projects that have users.

Generally speaking, on collaborative projects we'll consider our `main` branch on our `origin` remote sacred. Indeed, it's probably good practice to keep the `main` branch of your local repository
sacred as well. 

> Generally, this means we will never commit _directly_ to the `main` branch anywhere. 
{:.blockquote-no-margin}

Instead we will commit to a local
_branch_ and then use a process called a Pull Request to get our local
branch into our remote `main` branch, then we'll use `fetch` and
`pull` to sync our local branch with the remote.

This is convenient because it allows us to apply some basic _process_
to our pull requests (e.g. static analysis, testing, code review) to
make sure only quality, working code makes it into our _main_ branch.

Let's start by listing all of our branches using the `branch`
subcommand.

```
git branch
* main
```

You only have the main branch. Let's create a new branch in our
`exercises` repository.

```
git branch one-set
```

Hmmmm. No output. Let's rerun the command from above to see our
branches.

```
git branch
* main
  one-set
```

The asterisk (*) means you are still on the `main` branch. You can
also see this by checking the state of your repository. Do that. Where
do you see that specified?

Let's `checkout` the `one-set` branch.

```
git checkout one-set
```

Confirm you are indeed on the `one-set`
branch (use `git status`)

> ### Add to README.md
> #### Describe Different Approaches to Solving This Problem
> Describe the two different ways to figure out all of the duplicate values of a list of integers in english. The first solution is the nested loop solution. The second solution is to use a dictionary or a map (similar to the `containsPair` method we wrote in class. Describe both in as much detail as you can (with no code) and describe the trade-offs between the two solutions.

Now let's commit this change to our `README.md` file. Note that as long as you're on the correct branch, all git operations will happen on that branch. Maybe check you're on the correct branch one more time? Once you're confident, add and commit your changes.

Now let's look at our history again. You should have several commits now. One of those commits is the top of `main` and one of those commits is the top of `one-set`. There's also one that's labeled `HEAD`. Which one?

Now let's checkout our `main` branch and check our history again. What's different? 
* Is `HEAD` the same? 
* If you look at your `README.md` file in VS Code (or by "catting" it), is it the same?

Describe in english what happened here.

### Still More Practice

{:.info}
> **Programming Readiness: Practice (R4 and R6)**
> Implement the Java version first. After it works, you may optionally translate your own solution into Python to practice language transfer.

**DO NOT USE CHAT GPT FOR THIS SECTION**

You may use Google, but you may not cut and paste any code. It's much
better to only use the documentation for the [Python
Set](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#sets) or
the [Java
Set](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Set.html).

Now we're going to solve question one using a set or hashmap data structure instead of nested loops. Implement this version in the Java file you already made and run the same edge-case checks. In `README.md`, explain why this strategy changes the expected runtime and identify any memory tradeoff.

Once you're done, commit your changes to the `one-set` branch. Double
check you're on the right branch before committing.

Remember the `diff` subcommand? Note that you can use the `diff`
subcommand to compare your two branches!

```
git diff main..one-set
```

### Pull Requests

Let's create a pull request by pushing our local branch to our
remote. Previously, we pushed to `main` but we don't want to do that
anymore. Instead, we want to push to our new branch.

```
git push origin one-set
```

What do you see? Note that there's a URL there that will take you to a
page that allows you to immediately create a pull request. Instead of
doing that, visit the homepage of your repository on Github. Notice
that at the top it also allows you to create a pull request.

Before doing that, notice that the dropdown that says `main` also
shows your new branch! You can click the drop-down and explore the
code in your branch before making a pull request.

Let's make a pull request now. You can do it in either of the two ways
that I described above.

Notice that the pull request title is pre-populated based on your
commit message. That may be okay, but if you have multiple commits in
your branch you might want to change it.

More interesting is the `Preview` tab. Github supports Markdown for
your pull request description! This means you can easily add links,
lists, and preformatted code snippets to your pull request
description. Add all of those things.

You can also add screenshots fairly easily. Take a screenshot of your
VS Code instance or of your SSH window. Once it's on your clipboard,
you can paste it directly in the description edit box. It will upload
the image and add some markdown. Now click on the Preview tab and you
will see it!

Create your pull request. In the upper right hand section, you'll see
the "Reviewers" section. Add me as a reviewer. If your repository is
private, you'll need to add me to it first by going into the
repository settings and adding me under "Collaborators".

### Merging a Pull Request

Click on the drop-down arrow in the green "Merge pull request"
button. There are three options there. Based on our discusssion in
class, what do the three options mean? 

> What do the three "Merge pull request" options mean? Add them to your `answers.md`
file.

No need to wait for Sarah to actually review it. Go ahead and choose
"Rebase and Merge" and then delete the branch.

### Post Merge

Perhaps interestingly, merging doesn't actually change anything in
your local repository. You can confirm this by examining the state of
both of your branches in your local repository.

You can pull the latest updates in your remote repository without
affecting your local repositories by using the `fetch` subcommand.

```
git fetch
```

Now check the state of the two branches on your local repository. What
do you see?

You can use `pull` to actually pull the latest changes into your local
branch. In this case, on the main branch, pull the changes.

```
git pull
```

Now you can delete your local `one-set` branch since we don't need it
anymore.

```
git branch -D one-set
```

## Summary

We've learned a lot about Git in this lab, but much of it should have
been familiar from Lab 1 and Lab 2. You should be comfortable with the following git subcommands:

* init
* add
* commit
* log
* diff
* remote
* push
* branch
* checkout
* fetch
* pull

Now that you're finished, let's read the the following sections in
[Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2). They should be mostly
review at this point, but there's a few new things in there.

* Chapter 2, sections 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
* Chapter 3, sections 1, 2, 3, 6

## What to Submit
Before you submit, make sure that you have completed the following:

{:.checkbox-list}
* You have created and pushed a new repo called `lab03-exercises` to your GitHub account.
* The `main` branch has nested loop implementations of a "find duplicates" function/method in both Java and Python.
* The `one-set` branch has dictionary (or hashmap) implementations of a "find duplicates" function/method in both Java and Python.
* You have answered all of the questions in your `answers.md` file.
* You have committed your `answers.md` to your branch in the `class-exercises-fall2026` repository and make a pull request that points to **your** main branch.
* Then paste a link to your pull request in the Moodle.
