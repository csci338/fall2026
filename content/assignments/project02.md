## Collaboration & AI Policy


**You may:**
- Work in **pairs** or individually on this assignment -- your choice. 
- If you work with a partner:
    - both parties must have their own individual repo and deploy their own repo on Railway
    - Any extra credit earned will be split evenly between the two partners to ensure fairness (e.g., if 10 extra credit points are awarded, each person will receive 5 points)
- Discuss concepts, approaches, and debugging strategies with classmates
- Share links to documentation, tutorials, or Stack Overflow posts
- Help each other understand error messages or explain how technologies work
- Use AI tools (ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, etc.) to help understand concepts, debug errors, or generate small code snippets

**You may NOT:**
- Share, copy, or view another student's code (including via screenshots, GitHub repos), unless it is with your partner
- Submit code written by someone else (including AI-generated code that you don't understand)
- Use AI tools to generate large portions of your application without understanding what the code does
- Post your code publicly or share it in a way that others can copy it

**Remember:** The goal is for you to learn and demonstrate your understanding. If you can't explain how your code works, you haven't learned it. All submitted code must be your own work, even if you received help understanding concepts or debugging issues.
